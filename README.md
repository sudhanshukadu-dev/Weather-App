# 🌤️ Weather App

This is a simple **Weather App** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app uses the **OpenWeather API** to fetch real-time weather data and display it for any city entered by the user.

The app dynamically updates weather details including temperature, description, and weather icons based on the user's input.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 Real-time weather data fetching from the **OpenWeather API**.
- 🌡️ Displays current weather information including:
  - Temperature (in Celsius)
  - Weather description (e.g., "clear sky", "rain", etc.)
  - 🌦️ Custom weather icons based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, thunderstorm).
- 🎨 Background color dynamically changes based on the weather conditions.
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design for optimal display on all devices.

## ⚙️ How It Works
